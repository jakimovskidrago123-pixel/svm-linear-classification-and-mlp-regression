# svm-linear-classification-and-mlp-regression
mplemented linear SVM-style hinge loss classification from scratch using pure NumPy and gradient descent. Performed learning-rate analysis, hyperparameter sweeps (C vs η), and compared to logistic regression baseline. Extended task: MLP regressors for soybean crop yield prediction, full grid search + feature importance analysis. Achieved R² ≈ 1.0
